class BoundarySeekingGAN(AbstractPyTorchNetwork):
    """
    A Basic Implementation of the boundary seeking generative adversarial
    networks with variable generator and discriminator class

    This GAN derivate is trained by applying policy gradients to the generator
    to make it working with non-differentiable, discrete data. It also
    improves stability of training in continuous data.

    Warnings
    --------
    This Network is designed for training only; if you want to predict from an
    already trained network, it might be best, to split this network into its
    parts (i. e. separating the discriminator from the generator). This will
    give a significant boost in inference speed and a significant decrease in
    memory consumption, since no memory is allocated for additional weights of
    the unused parts and no inference is done for them. If this whole network
    is used, inferences might be done multiple times per network, to obtain
    all necessary (intermediate) outputs for training.
